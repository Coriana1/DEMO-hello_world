# hello_world
My first website!

<git> -> Keeps a history of changes, multiple developers can work on the same code at the same time and their work won't interfere with the other.
  commit - represents successive versions of file(s), and it's similar as the "save as" feature.
    *Each Commit (snapshot) has a label point to it, also known as the HEAD
        ~ HEAD = The label meaning "You Are Here"
        ~ Message = Gives a snapshot a label
        
Github -> You code in cloud that you can share code with others
  Git is used to help you manage your team work, tracks versions and keeps them separte until you add them in!
  
  *Git + GitHub = Teams can work on the same file without messing on another up, while also keeping up with the latest versions, and can sync your computer with what is online. 
   
    *Repositories -> Collection of files you told Git to pay attention to (a folder/directory that Git is tracking). 
      1. Stashing Changes Git Stash- Use when you are not ready to commit changes but do not want to lose them either. Temporarily removes changes and hides them, giving you a clean working directory. 
      2. Remote Repositories - Teams can use remote repositories to push information to and pull data from.
      3. Cloned Repositories - Automatically give the name “origin” to the server from which you cloned and the name “master” to your local branch.
