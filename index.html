        <p>Cake is something that is not celebrated enough. Even though cake is the special guest at most all our most memorable moments. I guess it is safe to say cake most always saves the day. Whether your first recollection was your favorite birthday or a promotion at work, cake was never fashionably late!</p>

          <p>Why settle with something salty, when you can have soemthing sweet. Cake never seems to disappoint me! There are so many different ways to enjoy cake, which is the beauty in it. It never gets old and it can be served warm or paired with something cold!</p>
